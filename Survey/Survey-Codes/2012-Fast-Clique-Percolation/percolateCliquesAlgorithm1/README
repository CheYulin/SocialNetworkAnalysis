== Compiling ==

	make clean percolateCliques 

== Usage ==


	./justTheCliques your_edge_list.txt kValue outputFile.out
 
where kValue is the value of k required, and output file will be a list of communities; one community per line, each community is a space seperated list of node ids

== Input file ==

Each line of the your_edge_list.txt represents an edge. The first two fields
(delimited by commas, pipes(|), spaces or tabs) are the names of the two
nodes that are connected. Directionality is ignored, and self-loops will be rejected.
Any other fields on the line are also ignored.
