  - Link Prediction  
  Hot topic : edge probability matrix,  
  Application : drug traffic analysis,

2. Relationship Between Static Network and Node Covariates  
  - Example: follow relationship along with user profiles such as gender, hobby, etc(Covariates).
  - Topic1 : use network to analyze node covariates  
  - Topic2 : combine node covariates clustering structure with network clustering structure, enhance accuracy in finite sample  
  (Since in reality, network is small, which could not guarantee enough nodes for 100% accuracy.)  
  - Topic3 : explorative tools for analysis

3. Dynamic Network Analysis
  - Example : tweet, weibo, left-message, share and response in webchat, edges have timestamps  
  - Topic : assume stability(problem with event-based property)
