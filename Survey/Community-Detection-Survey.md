	- Time comlexity  
	- Parallelism (**My Imagination**)  

- Algorithm Applicability  
	- Density sensitivity  
	- Overlapping sensitivity  
	- Outliers sensitivity  
	- Different distribution(e.g, DBLP , Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal) sensitivity  

- Result Quality Metrics  
	- With ground truth : cross common fraction, jaccard index, normalized mutual information  
	- W/O ground truth : clustering coefficient, strength(intensity of detected communitites), modularity(compares result with a randomized one)  
	- Evalutation methods: 1) use closed benchmarks, 2) visualize hierarchically clustering results  

##Possible Research Points(Especiallly on Directed Graph)
1. Evaluate prior detection methods(non-overlapping, overlapping, hierarchical) on metric and scalability (**WWW, ASONAM**)
2. Implement userful algorithms on **GraphX(Scala), PowerGraph(C++), Giraph(Java)** and estimate efficiency and analyze hwo to transparent sequential one into parallel environment (**SC, IPDPS**)  
3. Implement algorithms with GPU/MIC acceleration (**My Imagination**)  
2. Study fast local community search/query (**VLDB, SIGMOD**)  
2. Study Sampling large scale graph for approximated structure (**KDD**)  
3. Study index technique to help combine several algorithms for social network analysis (**My Imagination**)  
1. Visulize algorithm execuation procedures(i.e. how community form especially in hierarchical algorithms) (**My Imagination**)
