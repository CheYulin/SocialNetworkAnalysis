##Todo List
- Reimplement normalized mutual information, omega index, modularity and other related quality metrics.  

- Integrate benchmark graphs respectively from real-world and synthetic datasets and design test cases for different kinds of algorithms.  

- Reimplement five different types of overlapping community detection algorithms mentioned in [Overlapping community detection in networks: The State-of-the Art and Comparative Study](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2501657).  

- Reimplement new metrics and algorithms after 2013 and think of designing domain specific language(Need to implement interpreter-like thing) to make them easy to fit into quality and evaluation framework.  

- Implement automatic parallel engine and analysis engine.
